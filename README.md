# Hello! Welcome to Bitcoin-Locker,
## My Project for the 2021 Fintech Hackathon

There are two folders here
- frontend-files is the folder for all frontend files being used (minus the SSL and Bitcoin key files)
- java-backend for the **ENTIRE** backend server source, all the way down to the HTTP requests, so no Nginx or Apache here!

# Some TODO's
- [ ] Make error message when running on Windows
- [ ] Add sending history and transaction history to a SQL database (if not, just use .csv)
- [ ] Setup emailing via SMTP from jacobcohen.tech to jacbo@jacobcohen.info when a serious error happens (REALLY rare but maybe)
