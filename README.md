# Hello! Welcome to Bitcoin-Locker,
## My Project for the 2021 Fintech Hackathon

There are two folders here
- frontend-files is the folder for all frontend files being used (minus the SSL and Bitcoin key files)
- java-backend for the **ENTIRE** backend server source, all the way down to the HTTP requests, so no Nginx or Apache here!
