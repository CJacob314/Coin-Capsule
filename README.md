# Hello! Welcome to Coin Capsule,
## My Project for the 2021 Fintech Hackathon

There are two folders here
- frontend-files is the folder for all frontend files being used (minus the SSL and Bitcoin key files)
- java-backend for the **ENTIRE** backend server source, all the way down to the HTTP requests, so no Nginx or Apache here!

# Some TODO's
- [x] ~~Make error message when running on Windows~~ Not necessary
- [x] Added detailed history logged to .log files with exact times
- [ ] Setup emailing via SMTP from jacobcohen.tech to jacbo@jacobcohen.info when a serious error happens (REALLY rare but maybe) 

## Credits to
- [https://nicepage.com/](Nicepage) for most of the HTML and CSS. A lot went unused and could be trimmed if I had additional time.
- [https://bitcoinj.org/](Bitcoinj), a library for Java to interact with the Bitcoin protocol 
- Matthias Braun here https://stackoverflow.com/a/56794765/7359826, for the very barebones skeleton start to my custom HTTP server in Java
